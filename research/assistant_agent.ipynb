      "  <h3>Introduction</h3>\n",
      "  <p>Welcome to the fascinating world of Atomic Structure, a fundamental concept in Physics that helps us understand the building blocks of our universe. At its core, Atomic Structure is the study of the tiny atoms that make up everything around us, from the air we breathe to the stars in the sky. It's a topic that delves into the intricate details of an atom's composition, including the protons, neutrons, and electrons that come together to form the atoms of different elements. By exploring Atomic Structure, you'll gain a deeper understanding of how these tiny particles interact and influence the properties of matter, energy, and the world we experience.</p>\n",
      "  <p>This topic is considered moderately challenging, requiring a solid foundation in basic Physics concepts, such as forces, motion, and energy. It's essential to have a good grasp of these concepts before diving into Atomic Structure. If you're new to Physics, we recommend starting with the basics and gradually building your way up to this topic.</p>\n",
