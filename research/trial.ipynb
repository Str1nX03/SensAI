      "In the previous lessons, we have studied the Cartesian coordinate system, which is based on the concept of rectangular coordinates. However, there are situations where it is more convenient to use a different type of coordinate system, known as polar coordinates. Polar coordinates are a way of representing points in a plane using the distance from a fixed point (the origin) and the angle from a fixed direction (the positive x-axis).\n",

      "**What are Polar Coordinates?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Polar coordinates are a pair of numbers (r, θ) that represent a point in a plane. Here, r is the distance from the origin to the point, and θ is the angle from the positive x-axis to the line segment connecting the origin to the point.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Concepts**\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Polar Axis**: The polar axis is the line that passes through the origin and is perpendicular to the plane of the polar coordinates.\n",
      "- **Polar Angle**: The polar angle is the angle from the positive x-axis to the line segment connecting the origin to the point.\n",
      "- **Polar Radius**: The polar radius is the distance from the origin to the point.\n",

      "**Converting Cartesian to Polar Coordinates**\n",
      "\n",
      "To convert Cartesian coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, θ), we use the following formulas:\n",
      "\n",
      "r = √(x^2 + y^2)\n",
      "θ = arctan(y/x)\n",

      "**Converting Polar to Cartesian Coordinates**\n",
      "\n",
      "To convert polar coordinates (r, θ) to Cartesian coordinates (x, y), we use the following formulas:\n",
      "\n",
      "x = r cos(θ)\n",
      "y = r sin(θ)\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example Problems**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Convert the Cartesian coordinates (3, 4) to polar coordinates.\n",
      "r = √(3^2 + 4^2) = √(9 + 16) = √25 = 5\n",
      "θ = arctan(4/3) = 0.927 radians\n",
      "2. Convert the polar coordinates (6, π/4) to Cartesian coordinates.\n",
      "x = 6 cos(π/4) = 6(1/√2) = 6/√2\n",
      "y = 6 sin(π/4) = 6(1/√2) = 6/√2\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion**\n",
      "\n",
      "Polar coordinates are a powerful tool for representing points in a plane. They are particularly useful in situations where the distance from a fixed point and the angle from a fixed direction are more convenient to work with than the rectangular coordinates.\n",
