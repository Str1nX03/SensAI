It differs from other branches of mathematics, such as algebra and geometry, in that it deals with dynamic systems and rates of change, rather than static quantities. The primary focus of calculus is on understanding how functions change and behave, and it provides a powerful tool for modeling and analyzing real-world phenomena.\n",

      "\n",
      "<b>Solution:</b> The concept of a limit is a fundamental idea in calculus, and it is used to define and study the behavior of functions as the input values approach a certain point. The definition of a limit is as follows: a function f(x) has a limit L as x approaches a if, for every positive real number ε, there exists a positive real number δ such that, for all x, 0 < |x - a| < δ implies |f(x) - L| < ε.\n",

One-sided limits occur when the function approaches a value as x approaches a from one side, but not from the other side. Infinite limits occur when the function approaches infinity as x approaches a certain point. Limits at infinity occur when the function approaches a value as x approaches infinity or negative infinity.</p>\n",

      "<b>Solution:</b>\n",
      "<p>To evaluate the limit of the function f(x) = (x^2 - 4) / (x - 2) as x approaches 2, we can start by factoring the numerator. The numerator can be factored as (x + 2)(x - 2). Therefore, the function can be rewritten as f(x) = ((x + 2)(x - 2)) / (x - 2). By canceling out the common factor (x - 2), we get f(x) = x + 2. Now, we can evaluate the limit by substituting x = 2 into the simplified function, which gives us lim x→2 (x + 2) = 2 + 2 = 4.</p>\n",

In other words, a function is continuous at a point if its graph can be drawn without lifting the pencil from the paper at that point.

      "<b>Solution:</b>\n",
      "<p>The concept of an introduction to limits begins with the definition of a limit. The limit of a function f(x) as x approaches a value a is denoted by lim x→a f(x) and represents the value that the function approaches as x gets arbitrarily close to a. The notation for a limit is lim x→a f(x) = L, which reads \"the limit as x approaches a of f(x) is L\".</p>\n",
      "<p>One of the basic properties of limits is that the limit of a function as x approaches a value a is the same as the limit of the function as x approaches a from the right or from the left.

On the other hand, if we approach 0 from the left, the values of f(x) = 1 / x become larger and larger in the negative direction, approaching -∞.

      "<b>Solution:</b>\n",
      "<p>The properties of limits are essential in evaluating the limits of complex functions. One of the fundamental properties of limits is the linearity property, which states that the limit of a linear combination of functions is equal to the linear combination of the limits of the individual functions. Mathematically, this can be expressed as lim x→a (af(x) + bg(x)) = a * lim x→a f(x) + b * lim x→a g(x), where a and b are constants.</p>\n",
      "<p>Another important property of limits is the homogeneity property, which states that the limit of a function multiplied by a constant is equal to the constant times the limit of the function. This can be expressed as lim x→a (c * f(x)) = c * lim x→a f(x), where c is a constant.</p>\n",
      "<p>The sum, difference, and product properties of limits are also crucial in evaluating the limits of complex functions. The sum property states that the limit of the sum of two functions is equal to the sum of the limits of the individual functions, i.e., lim x→a (f(x) + g(x)) = lim x→a f(x) + lim x→a g(x). The difference property states that the limit of the difference of two functions is equal to the difference of the limits of the individual functions, i.e., lim x→a (f(x) - g(x)) = lim x→a f(x) - lim x→a g(x). The product property states that the limit of the product of two functions is equal to the product of the limits of the individual functions, i.e., lim x→a (f(x) * g(x)) = lim x→a f(x) * lim x→a g(x).</p>\n",

Using the difference property, we have lim x→2 (f(x) - g(x)) = lim x→2 (2x + 1 - 3x + 2) = lim x→2 (-x + 3) = -2 + 3 = 1. Using the product property, we have lim x→2 (f(x) * g(x)) = lim x→2 (2x + 1) * lim x→2 (3x - 2) = (2 * 2 + 1) * (3 * 2 - 2) = 5 * 4 = 20.</p>\n",

      "<b>Solution:</b> \n",
      "<p>To determine the continuity of a function at a point, we need to check if the following conditions are met: (1) the function is defined at the point, (2) the limit of the function as x approaches the point exists, and (3) the limit of the function as x approaches the point is equal to the value of the function at the point. If any of these conditions are not met, the function is said to be discontinuous at that point.</p>\n",
      "<p>In the case of the function f(x) = (x^2 - 4) / (x - 2), we can see that it is not defined at x = 2, since the denominator becomes zero at this point. However, we can simplify the function by factoring the numerator: f(x) = ((x - 2)(x + 2)) / (x - 2). Canceling out the common factor (x - 2), we get f(x) = x + 2, which is defined for all x, including x = 2.</p>\n",
      "<p>Now, we can evaluate the limit of the function as x approaches 2: lim (x→2) (x^2 - 4) / (x - 2) = lim (x→2) (x + 2) = 2 + 2 = 4. Since the limit exists and is equal to the value of the simplified function at x = 2, we can conclude that the function f(x) = (x^2 - 4) / (x - 2) is continuous at x = 2, even though it is not defined in its original form.</p>\n",

      "<b>Solution:</b> \n",
      "<p>There are three main types of discontinuities: removable discontinuity, jump discontinuity, and infinite discontinuity. A removable discontinuity occurs when a function is not defined at a point, but the limit of the function as x approaches that point exists. A jump discontinuity occurs when the limit of the function as x approaches a point from the left and right are different. An infinite discontinuity occurs when the limit of the function as x approaches a point is infinite.</p>\n",
      "<p>Let's analyze the given functions: f(x) = 1 / x has an infinite discontinuity at x = 0, since the limit of the function as x approaches 0 from the right is positive infinity, and the limit as x approaches 0 from the left is negative infinity. The function g(x) = |x| / x has a jump discontinuity at x = 0, since the limit of the function as x approaches 0 from the right is 1, and the limit as x approaches 0 from the left is -1. The function h(x) = x^2 sin(1 / x) has a removable discontinuity at x = 0, since the limit of the function as x approaches 0 exists and is equal to 0, but the function is not defined at x = 0 in its original form.</p>\n",
      "<p>In summary, the types of discontinuities are: (1) removable discontinuity: the function is not defined at a point, but the limit exists; (2) jump discontinuity: the limit from the left and right are different; and (3) infinite discontinuity: the limit is infinite.

      "<p>The derivative of a function f(x) is a measure of how the function changes as its input changes.

      "<p>Let's apply this definition to the function f(x) = x^2. We have: f'(x) = lim (h→0) (f(x + h) - f(x)) / h = lim (h→0) ((x + h)^2 - x^2) / h. Expanding the squared term, we get: f'(x) = lim (h→0) (x^2 + 2hx + h^2 - x^2) / h = lim (h→0) (2hx + h^2) / h.</p>\n",
      "<p>Simplifying the expression, we get: f'(x) = lim (h→0) (2x + h) = 2x. Therefore, the derivative of the function f(x) = x^2 is f'(x) = 2x.

      "<b>Solution:</b> The definition of a derivative is given by the formula: f'(x) = lim(h → 0) [f(x + h) - f(x)]/h. This formula represents the limit of the average rate of change of the function f(x) as the change in the input (h) approaches zero. To illustrate this concept, consider the example of a function f(x) = x^2. Using the definition of a derivative, we can calculate the derivative of this function as follows: f'(x) = lim(h → 0) [f(x + h) - f(x)]/h = lim(h → 0) [(x + h)^2 - x^2]/h = lim(h → 0) [x^2 + 2hx + h^2 - x^2]/h = lim(h → 0) [2hx + h^2]/h = lim(h → 0) 2x + h = 2x.

      "<b>Solution:</b> The power rule states that if f(x) = x^n, then f'(x) = nx^(n-1). For example, if f(x) = x^3, then f'(x) = 3x^(3-1) = 3x^2. The product rule states that if f(x) = u(x)v(x), then f'(x) = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x). For example, if f(x) = x^2sin(x), then f'(x) = (2x)sin(x) + x^2cos(x). The quotient rule states that if f(x) = u(x)/v(x), then f'(x) = (u'(x)v(x) - u(x)v'(x)) / v(x)^2. For example, if f(x) = (x^2 + 1) / (x + 1), then f'(x) = ((2x)(x + 1) - (x^2 + 1)(1)) / (x + 1)^2. The chain rule states that if f(x) = g(h(x)), then f'(x) = g'(h(x)) \\* h'(x). For example, if f(x) = sin(x^2), then f'(x) = cos(x^2) \\* (2x) = 2xcos(x^2).

      "<b>Solution:</b> To illustrate the relationship between the power rule and product rule, consider the example of a function f(x) = x^2sin(x). To find the derivative of this function, we can use the product rule, which states that f'(x) = u'(x)v(x) + u(x)v'(x). In this case, u(x) = x^2 and v(x) = sin(x). Using the power rule, we can find the derivative of u(x) as u'(x) = 2x. The derivative of v(x) is v'(x) = cos(x). Therefore, using the product rule, we have f'(x) = (2x)sin(x) + x^2cos(x). This example illustrates how the power rule and product rule can be used together to find the derivative of a function. The power rule is used to find the derivative of the individual components of the function (in this case, x^2 and sin(x)), while the product rule is used to combine these derivatives to find the derivative of the overall function.

      "<b>Solution:</b> Derivatives are a powerful tool for solving optimization problems. They provide a way to analyze the rate of change of a function, which is essential for identifying the maximum or minimum of a function. By using derivatives, we can determine the optimal values of variables that achieve this maximum or minimum. One common technique used to optimize functions using derivatives is to find the critical points of a function. Critical points occur where the derivative of a function is equal to zero or undefined. These points can correspond to the maximum or minimum of a function, or to a point of inflection. To determine the nature of these critical points, we can use the first derivative test or the second derivative test. The first derivative test involves examining the sign of the derivative to the left and right of a critical point, while the second derivative test involves examining the sign of the second derivative at the critical point. Another technique used to optimize functions using derivatives is to apply optimization algorithms such as gradient descent or Newton's method. Gradient descent involves iteratively updating the values of variables to minimize a function, using the gradient of the function to guide the updates. Newton's method involves using the Hessian matrix of a function to update the values of variables, and is often more efficient than gradient descent for large-scale optimization problems. Examples of optimization problems that can be solved using derivatives include finding the maximum or minimum of a function, optimizing a system of equations, and optimizing a dynamic system over time. To solve these problems, we typically follow a series of steps. First, we define the objective function and the constraints of the problem. Next, we compute the derivative of the objective function, and use this derivative to identify the critical points of the function. We then apply the first derivative test or the second derivative test to determine the nature of these critical points, and select the optimal solution. Finally, we verify the optimality of the solution, using techniques such as checking the second derivative or examining the behavior of the function near the critical point. In conclusion, derivatives play a crucial role in optimization problems, providing a way to analyze the rate of change of a function and identify the maximum or minimum. Common techniques used to optimize functions using derivatives include finding the critical points of a function, using the first derivative test or the second derivative test, and applying optimization algorithms such as gradient descent or Newton's method.
